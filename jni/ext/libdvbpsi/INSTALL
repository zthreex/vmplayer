INSTALL file for "libdvbpsi".


Configuring "libdvbpsi"
=======================

A typical way to configure libdvbpsi is:

  ./configure --prefix=/usr

See './configure --help' for more information.

If you intend to debug stuff, you may want to compile with debugging
symbols:

  ./configure --enable-debug

If you want a fully optimized version you should use

  ./configure --enable-release


Building "libdvbpsi"
====================

Once configured, run 'make' to build the library and the programs
located in the 'examples' and 'misc' directories.


Installing and using "libdvbpsi"
================================

You can install the library, its headers and the programs located in
the 'examples' directory by typing:

  make install

Including one of the headers is done by adding the following line in
your '.c' file:

  #include <dvbpsi/dvbpsi.h>

The program must be linked against the lib with the '-ldvbpsi' option
for gcc.

Building documentation
======================

Once configured, run 'make doc' to build the documentation in html
(doc/doxygen/html) and latex (doc/doxygen/latex). You'll need the
doxygen tool (http://www.doxygen.org/) and the graphviz tool
(http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz).
