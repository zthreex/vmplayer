TODO:
- change int's used as bool into bools
- Synchronize all dvbpsi_GatherXXXSections() sanity checks
- Check memleak in dvbpsi_GatherXXXSections() functions with dvbpsi_DeletePSISections(p_section) usages,
  I think all tables might be leaking memory of p_secion pointers now
- unify dvbpsi_descriptor_t functions and message callback
- make dvbpsi_NewXXX() and dvbpsi_DeleteXXX() real functions (maybe)?
- use dvbpsi_NewXXX() and dvbpsi_DeleteXXX() in dvbpsi_GatherXXXSections() functions
- write SIS Command Decoders
- find solution for SIS descriptors decoding, since they use the same tag-id as PMT descriptors do.
